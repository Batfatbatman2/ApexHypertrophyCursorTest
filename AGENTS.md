## Project Overview

Apex Hypertrophy is a premium hypertrophy training app (iOS, Android, Web). As of now, the repository contains **only a product specification document** at `.github/workflows/ApexHypertrophy2.7FeatureDocument.yml` — no source code, dependencies, or build system exist yet.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- **No application code exists.** There are no source files, package manifests, or build configurations to install or run.
- **No dependencies to install.** The update script is intentionally a no-op (`true`).
- **No lint, test, or build commands** are available until application code is added.
- **The spec document** (`.github/workflows/ApexHypertrophy2.7FeatureDocument.yml`) is a feature specification, not a GitHub Actions workflow, despite its location and extension.
- When source code is added, this file should be updated with setup, lint, test, and run instructions.
